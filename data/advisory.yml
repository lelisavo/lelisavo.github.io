subtitle: >
  SOFAR Acoustics, LLC is a research and development consulting company focused on creating innovative solutions that combine science and advanced technology. We provide services in two major areas of specialization: acoustics and information technology. In the area of acoustics we offer scientific and engineering solutions in underwater acoustics, structural  dynamics and vibration, ocean-seismo acoustics, signal processing, and data fusion. This work is often based on integrating science and engineering with our information technology prowess in distributed sensor networks, embedded linux systems, and cloud computing applications. Backed by an established record of our professional capabilities in both research industry and academic settings, we provide R & D solutions for government sponsors such as the Office of Naval Research (ONR) and the  Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA), as well as for clients in the academia and the industry.
