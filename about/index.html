        <p>SOFAR Acoustics, LLC is a research and development consulting company focused on creating innovative solutions that combine science and advanced technology. We provide services in two major areas of specialization: acoustics and information technology. In the area of acoustics we offer scientific and engineering solutions in underwater acoustics, structural  dynamics and vibration, ocean-seismo acoustics, signal processing, and data fusion. This work is often based on integrating science and engineering with our information technology prowess in distributed sensor networks, embedded linux systems, and cloud computing applications. Backed by an established record of our professional capabilities in both research industry and academic settings, we provide R &amp; D solutions for government sponsors such as the Office of Naval Research (ONR) and the  Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA), as well as for clients in the academia and the industry.

          <h4>President and Chief Executive Officer</h4>
          <p><img src="/img/irena.jpg" alt="Img" height="275" width="" align="left" hspace=10>Irena Lucifredi, President and founder of SOFAR Acoustics, received her Ph.D. in Acoustics and Structural Dynamics from  MIT in 2004 and her B.S. in Mechanical Engineering from Illinois Institute of Technology in 1996. Her Ph. D. dissertation work identified, analyzed and explained the fundamental effects of the sediment and the proximity of the seabed interface on acoustic scattering from elastic mines insonified using a mine-hunting SONAR. Since 2004 she has been leading independent research and development in a small business R &amp;D setting in the field of underwater acoustics,  developing wave-based computational propagation and scattering models, and devising novel acoustic sensing SONAR systems and signal processing techniques for complex littoral environments. She has also been appointed a research fellow at Harvard University where she investigated novel computational and experimental methods in seismo-acoustic range-dependent propagation and scattering. Dr. Lucifredi has also lead a number of initiatives focused on active SONAR marine-mammal detection, classification, and aspect-dependent target strength; data fusion; and cloud-enabled track integration and management. Dr. Lucifredi has over ten journal publications and technical book reviews,  and has been a frequent contributor and invited speaker at conferences of professional societies such as the Acoustical Society of America, IEEE Oceans, and American Geophysical Union.
